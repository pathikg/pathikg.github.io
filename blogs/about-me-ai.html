            <p>
            In the realm of ones and zeros, a mind does dwell,<br>
            Pathik, the architect of silicon dreams, casts his spell.<br>
            From Bengaluru's bustling streets, his vision takes flight,<br>
            Machine learning's tapestry, he weaves day and night.
            </p>
            <p>
            At Pibit.ai, where innovation's seeds are sown,<br>
            His algorithms dance, their prowess shown.<br>
            Loss Runs whisper secrets, once hidden from sight,<br>
            Now revealed by YOLO's keen, artificial light.
            </p>
            <p>
            Azure clouds, his canvas; data, his paint,<br>
            With each model trained, efficiency's restraint<br>
            Fades away like mist in the morning sun,<br>
            A testament to battles fought and won.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the land of LLaMA, where knowledge blooms,<br>
            He crafts a tongue for dogs, dispelling gloom.<br>
            BudgetGPT, his creation, stands tall and proud,<br>
            Deciphering fiscal whispers, clear and loud.
            </p>
            <p>
            With skills sharp as a well-honed blade,<br>
            PyTorch, TensorFlow, his faithful aide,<br>
            In the cloud or on terra firma, he stands strong,<br>
            A maestro conducting the AI song.
            </p>
            <p>
            From Somaiya's halls, with knowledge rife,<br>
            He emerged, ready to give AI life.<br>
            Now he stands, at the forefront of the race,<br>
            Where man and machine intertwine with grace.
            </p>
            <p>
            So here's to Pathik, the AI poet true,<br>
            Crafting futures with each line of code anew.<br>
            In the grand tapestry of tech, he weaves his part,<br>
            A testament to science, creativity, and heart.
            </p>
